## Sorting

Sorting is any process of arranging items systematically, and has two common, yet distinct meanings: 1. ordering: arranging items in a sequence ordered by some criterion; 2. categorizing: grouping items with similar properties. Ordering items is the combination of categorizing them based on equivalent order, and ordering the categories themselves.
